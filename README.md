# remix
Application that uses Spotify's API and a content-filtering based recommender system to recommend new songs that might appeal to the user. 
### Planned Features:
<ul>
  <li>Spotify Login and playlist(s) linking.</li>
  <li>Suggest "same-vibe" songs based on Spotify account(s) or playlist(s) provided.</li>
  <li>Suggest songs based on selected "mood".</li>
  <li>Suggest similar songs based on one song provided</li>
</ul>
<br>
When suggesting songs, a list of 10 songs maximum will be displayed on the screen with the option of playing it.

DISCLAIMER: To avoid breaching Spotify's terms of service, the Spotify dataset is **NOT** used to train the model. Instead a 3rd party dataset linked /here/ is used to train the model. Unfortunately this means that songs released after /dataset publishing date/ will not be included in the training of the model.
